/** \page beginners XML input for beginners
    XML consists of a set of single line tags of the form \xe \<TAG \ex \xa attribute\ax="something" \xe/\>\ex,
    where \xe TAG \ex is a name such as Atom which will define the full XML
    tag, and \xa attribute\ax is, well, some attribute, which is set to the value "something".
    The second type of XML tag consists of something like,
    <BR>
      \xe\<TAG\ex\xa attribute \ax="whatever"\xe\>\ex<BR>
           ... other xml stuff or simple text...<BR>
      \xe\</TAG\>\ex
    <BR>
    Which can contains more XML tags, eg:
    <BR>
      \xe\<Structure\ex\xa scale \ax="6.2"\xe\>\ex<BR>
        \xe \<Atom \ex \xa x\ax="0" \xa y\ax="0.5" \xa z\ax="0.5" \xe/\>\ex <BR>
           ... <BR>
      \xe\</Structure\>\ex
    <BR>
    Both %types of XML tags are interchangeable. If you need to put tags within
    another tag, use the second form, if not, use the first. Finally, as not
    shown here, indent!!
    \warning
    Make sure that you put the \xe/\ex where it belongs (end of tag in first
    form, beginning of second tag in second form) or you may well get a seg
    fault. And make sure to always close the second type of tag, or you will
    not escape a seg-fault.
   
    The first line of any XML file should be
    \verbatim 
       <?xml version="1.0" standalone=no>
    \endverbatim
    LaDa looks for its input in  \xe\<Job\>\ex ... \xe\</Job\>\ex tags.
     \verbatim 
        <?xml version="1.0" standalone=no>
        <Job>
         ... lada input
        </Job>
    \endverbatim
