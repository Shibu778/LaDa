/** \ingroup MPI
  \page MPI Message Passing Interface
  This  page aims to regroup all MPI specific stuff. This includes anything in
the mpi namespace of course. But also all the mpi::serialize() and
t_Something::broadcast() functions declared all over the place. Finally, it
includes an hack which is specific to MPI, eg t_Something synchronize.
