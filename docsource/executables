    \section lamarckexe lamarck
    Prints out the energy and concentrations of each structure in input, where
    the energy is computed from the cluster expansion.
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.
   
    \section vffexe vff
    Prints out the energy, the strain tensor, and the minimized structure of
    each structure in input, where the energy is minimized using vff.
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.
   
    \section layeredvffexe layered_vff
    Prints out the energy, the strain tensor, and the minimized structure of
    each structure in input, where the energy is minimized using a "layered"
    vff. More explicitely, relaxation of the unit cell is only allowed along
    the first vector of that unit-cell. This program is intended for layered
    (epitaxial) optimizations. Note that the other vectors in the unit-cell can
    relax if they have a component along the first vector. Atoms are allowed to
    relax freely.
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.
   
    \section pescanexe escan
    Prints out the bandgap of the input structures, after strain relaxation.
    Also prints out the structure in xcrysden and LaDa format.
    The program works in one of two ways:
       - It tries to read GA optimized structures from within \<Results\> ...
      \</Results> tags. This allows for easy all-electron recomputations of
      optimized band-gaps.
       - If the above fails, it read the \<Structure\> tags found directly
       under \<Job\>...\</Job\>
       .
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.
      \param -s, --save XML file where GA results where saved. If this tag
      exists, the program assumes you want to verify results from a GA
      optimization. It will read structures from within \<Results\> ...
      \</Results> tags.
      \param -d, --donteval Does not do band-gap evaluations. Does vff
      relaxation and prints-out result.
   
    \section ceoptexe ce_opt
    Optimizes cluster expansions. This is a single-objective GA.
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.

     The input should look something like the following. (\sa input/bandgap_opt.xml)
     \code 
        <Job>
          <Lattice>
            ...
          </Lattice>
          <Structure>
            ...
          </Structure>
          <GA>
            ...
          </GA>
          <Functional type="CE">
            ...
          </Functional>
        </Job>
     \endcode
   
    \section bgoptexe bandgap_opt
     Optimizes band-gaps as computed from escan. This is a single-objective GA.
     It is intended for quaternaries (should work for ternaries as well). The
     \e x and \e y concentrations are set using a \ref TagConcentration tag.
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.

     The input should look something like the following.
     See test/bandgap_opt/input.xml for an actual example.
     \code 
        <Job>
          <Lattice>
            ...
          </Lattice>
          <Structure>
            ...
          </Structure>
          <GA>
            ...
          </GA>
          <Functional type="escan">
            ...
          </Functional>
          <Functional type="vff">
            ...
          </Functional>
          <Functional type="Concentration" a="??" b="??" c="??" />
        </Job>
     \endcode
   
    \section layeredoptexe layered_opt
     Optimizes in-plane stress as computed from vff and band-gaps as computed
     from escan. This is a two-objective GA (first stress, second band-gap).
     It is intended for quaternaries (should work for ternaries as well) where
     optimized structures span the minimal epitaxial unit-cell. As such
     structures are inputed in a special way (see below).
      \param -h, --help prints out options
      \param -i, --input file to read input from. Defaults to "input.xml" in current directory.

    Structures can be either loaded from input as done everywhere else or
    constructured. In the former case, the structure must be a minimal
    epitaxial structure, or results are not guaranteed (not that they are in
    any case). In the latter case the \ref TagStructure takes two attributes.
    See test/layered_opt/input.xml for an actual example.
    \code 
       <Job>
         <Lattice>
           ...
         </Lattice>
         <Structure direction="1 0 0" multplicity="5"/>
         <GA>
           <Objective>
             <Objective type="minimize"/> <!-- In-plane stress/>
             <Objective type="target" target=0.3/> <!-- bandgap/>
           </Objective>
           ...
         </GA>
         <Functional type="escan">
           ...
         </Functional>
         <Functional type="vff">
           ...
         </Functional>
       </Job>
    \endcode
    The direction \f$\mathbf{d}\f$ is a string of three numbers (mind the spaces. They are
    necessary) defining the epitaxial direction. The multiplicity \e m defines the
    number of (epitaxial) unit-cells to use in the epitaxial direction, eg the number of layers. 
    \f$m\mathbf{d}\f$ must be a vector of the direct lattice, in units of \a scale.
    \warning There is not \ref TagConcentration tag here. Concentrations are
    set by specifying a x0 attribute in the \<GA\> tag. 
    The \<Structure\> tag also accepts the following attributes \a PI, \a
    energy, \a scale. 
    \warning Do not forget to set the scale attribute of either in the lattice
    or the structure tag. Otherwise, results may be undetermined.
